Pseudo code is used by humans to describe the high level functions of an algorithm. It is language agnostic and is usually presented as a list or flow chart. The greatest advantage to using pseudo code is that it can be understood by a wide range of people, even those who are not developers. An example of pseudo code follows:

"I want to add a couple of numbers together using a program, what would this look like, programmer person?"

1. Create a function that takes the numbers you want to add together
2. Take your input for the numbers
3. Call the function, passing your input
4. Have the function do work (add the numbers together)
5. Either return the addition or display it to the user in the function
