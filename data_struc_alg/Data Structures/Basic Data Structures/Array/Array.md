Arrays are linear data structures that can hold elements and arrange them. With arrays being index based structures any index of the array can be accessed by directly. They are usually 0 indexed structures, meaning the first element of an array is assigned to the 0 index. Arrays are assigned a length when they are created and can not be changed dynamically. Python does not have true arrays in it's standard library. The following example will be in C#. It will create an array with 4 empty elements.

```
using System

namespace Something_Something_Program
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //the 4 sets the length of the array. This cannot be changed.
            string[] movies = new string[4] 

        }
    }
}
```
